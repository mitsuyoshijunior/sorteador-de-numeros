This project was created as part of a programming logic course by Alura.

## How It Works

To use it, simply select the quantity and the range of numbers you want. For example, if you want 10 different numbers within the range from 1 to 20, just select the quantity in the first field, the start of the range in "From number", and the end in "To number".

## Technologies Used

- HTML (provided by Alura)  
- CSS (provided by Alura)  
- JavaScript (custom logic developed by me)
